#+TITLE: Youtube Timestamp playlist downloader
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil 

* Background
The problem i am facing when listening to [[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R1IGG3ETEWHxhWxIuFCfkGwOZUy3W4syATL6RzQrURc/view][my gamelan playlist]], it is timestamp based playlist. That means i have to change the URL and timestamp manually whenever a song done. So i think it will be better if a could make a tools that can play this automatically.

* Usage
Before using this tool you have to specify the download directory and API_KEY. Make sure that you enables *Google Sheets API* in your API key. Add your google API Key in [[file:src/google_sheet.py::API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"][src/google_sheet.py]]

#+begin_src python
python playlist_manager.py update
python playlist_manager.py sync
#+end_src

There are 2 available commands
- update = to update playlist items
- sync = to download to mp3 file
